This project examines the stylistic and linguistic evolution of children’s literature from the 18th to the 21st century. 

By analyzing a curated corpus of fifteen influential books, we investigate how sentence structure, vocabulary, and narrative style have changed over time. Using natural language processing (NLP) and stylometric techniques, we measure shifts in average sentence length, syntactic complexity, lexical richness, and thematic emphasis.

The results reveal a clear transition from didactic, formal language in earlier works to simpler, clearer, and more accessible storytelling in modern texts. While moral instruction has declined, emotional tone has remained relatively stable, with a growing emphasis on inclusive themes such as identity, imagination, and empathy. These changes reflect a broader societal shift toward making children’s literature more engaging, balanced, and supportive for young readers.
